# Predictive Model for Proactive Layer Feed Efficiency Using Random Forest Regressor

## Description
This project is designed to predict Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) and optimize feeding practices for egg production using a Random Forest Regressor. It leverages features such as total feed intake, feeding behavior metrics, and feed composition to enhance feed efficiency and support data-driven decision-making for sustainable poultry farming.
