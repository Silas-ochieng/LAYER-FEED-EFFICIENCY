# Comprehensive Plan for Feed Conversion Ratio Prediction

## Plan:
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the necessary datasets related to feed efficiency, including FCR data, feeding behaviors, and chemical composition of feeds.

2. **Data Merging**:
   - Merge the datasets using the Bird ID as a common key to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to understand the relationships between different features, including visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train a Random Forest Regressor using the merged dataset to predict the feed conversion ratio (FCR).
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.

5. **Model Saving**:
   - Save the trained model for deployment in a Flask application.

6. **Flask Application**:
   - Integrate the model into a Flask application to allow for predictions based on user input.

## Follow-Up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
